## Widows and Orphans

APA style does not have a problem with widows and orphans. That is, a heading can be the last line of a page, and a sentence can end in the first line of a new page. The justification for this is that these are presentation considerations, and APA is all about preparing an article to submit to a journal. The journal itself will handle all these little details for you.

But... it looks pretty stupid. I've put an on/off switch for widows an orphans on the development pathway.
